## Ex. 1 — Simple questions

1. A system has two processes and three identical resources. Each process needs a maximum of two

   resources. Can a deadlock occur? Explain.

   

2. A computer has six tape drives, with n processes competing for them. Each process may need

   two drives. For which values of n is the system deadlock free?

   

3. A real-time system has four periodic events with periods of 50, 100, 200, and 250 msec each. Suppose the four events require 35, 20, 10, and x msec of CPU time, respectively. What is the largest value x for which the system is schedulable?

   

4. Round-robin schedulers normally maintain a list of all runnable processes, with each process oc- curring exactly once in the list. What would happen if a process occurred more than once in the list? Would there be any reason for allowing this?

   

5. Can a measure of whether a process is likely to be CPU bound or I/O bound be detected by analyzing the source code. How to determine it at runtime?
